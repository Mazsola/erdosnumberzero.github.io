{"name":"Erdosnumberzero","tagline":"","body":"I'm a software engineer working on image processing applications on the [Kalray](kalrayinc.com) many-core processor. I primarily code in C POSIX, but have also done projects in OpenCL and using the Kalray Dataflow programming model.\r\n\r\nI organise the [Paris Maker Girls meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Maker-Girls-Meetup/), which focuses on creating a community of women and girls interested in the Maker Movement. I organise workshops on electronics, Arduino projects, and soft circuits.\r\n\r\nI studied Electrical Engineering at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au), specialising in image and signal processing.\r\n\r\nIn my free time, I like to sketch, watch arthouse films, travel, and hang out with my dog Pipotch.\r\nCheck out my work on [Github](github.com/erdosnumberzero) (transfer in progress!) or follow me on [Twitter](twitter.com/maker_girl).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
